    <h1 class="post__title">How to Move a CenturyLink Fiber Modem &amp; ONT</h1>
    <p class="post__date">February 10, 2022</p>  
  </header>
  <section class="post__body"><p>Last week I switched from Comcast to CenturyLink. 200 mbps upload and download for $50/month feels like a good deal, and the service has been great so far.</p>
<p>I've ran a good bit of ethernet and coax cable wire over the years, but fiber was new to me. Evidently, it's much more finicky:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can't bend it as much</li>
<li>You're not supposed to look into the end of the cable (lasers?)</li>
<li>You can't get the end of the cable dirty</li>
</ul>
<h2>Moving the Fiber, Modem &amp; ONT downstairs</h2>
<p>Just to recap, the ONT is the box that sits between your fiber cable and your modem/router combo.</p>
<p><code>Fiber cable &lt;-&gt; ONT box &lt;-&gt; Ethernet cable &lt;-&gt; Modem/Router box</code></p>
<h3>1. Unplug Ethernet from ONT</h3>
<p>Before unplugging the Ethernet cable from your ONT, <strong>make note of which Ethernet port is being used</strong>.</p>
<p>Evidently, the ONT Ethernet port matters (it's not like a switch). CenturyLink can use a single ONT to service multiple customer modems. You'll need to plug your modem back into the same Ethernet port on the ONT after moving it, or your internet won't work.</p>
<p>I learned this the hard way... thought I screwed up the fiber cable only to have a CenturyLink guy fix my internet in 3 seconds by plugging the modem into the chosen Ethernet port on the ONT.</p>
<h3>2. Unplug Fiber from ONT and protect the end of the cable</h3>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/centurylink/comments/ko12be/how_do_you_unplug_the_fiber_cable_on_the_ont_box/">Reddit thread</a> on unplugging the fiber cable from your ONT.</p>
<p>Before you unplug the cable, have a plan for how to protect the end of it while you're moving it to the new location. In my case, I did several things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Used a sticky note and some tape to wrap a paper tube around the end of the cable, extending past the end to protect the tip. This way nothing is touching the tip if you set it down.</li>
<li>Later when running the wire through the wall, this paper tube got in the way, so I took it off and replaced it with a tape tube make of painter's tape that tapered to a cone at the end. This was much less sturdy, but kept the cord thin enough it went through the hole in the wall easily.</li>
<li>Stick the end of the cord in a ziplock bag when you're setting it down so it doesn't get dirty (especially if you're outside). Of course, you still need to protect the end of the cord first.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unplugging the cable is actually pretty easy. Just pull on the squarish green cable terminator, not on the cable itself. Pull it straight out with a steady hand -- don't bump it against the ONT! Then protect the tiny exposed fiber end w/out touching it or looking into the end of the cable.</p>
<h3>3. Run Fiber to new location</h3>
<p>This part will depend a lot on the job, but in my case the steps were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pry silicon caulk off the hole where fiber enters house</li>
<li>Pull fiber outside of house (put a bag on the end to keep it from getting dirty)</li>
<li>Drill hole into different part of the house (e.g. my basement)</li>
<li>Very carefully push protected cable end into that hole, then pull it all through from the inside</li>
<li>Seal up holes with exterior-rated silicon caulk</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Hook it all back up</h3>
<p>Remember to connect the modem to the same Ethernet port on the ONT that it was connected to before.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
