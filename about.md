# About Me

Hi, I'm Micah! I'm a 28-year-old frontend engineer based in Portland.

I'm currently heading up frontend dev at BeFunky, a popular WebGL-based [Photo Editor](https://www.befunky.com/create/) and [Graphic Design tool](https://www.befunky.com/create/designer/) that runs in the browser.

## Current Projects

In my free time, I'm working on a couple different things:

- Remodeling my basement
- Training a LSTM Neural Network to identify ads in podcasts

Just shoot me an email if you'd like to work on something together!

- Playing around with [object detection using Tensorflow](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-on-the-Raspberry-Pi) on a the Raspberry Pi B+.
- A silly, social webapp called [Any Mammal's Milk](http://anymammalsmilk.com) first written in Svelte then migrated to React + Firebase.
- A Preact-based [WordPress plugin](https://github.com/micahjon/network-database-search) for cleaner database searches.

## Goshen College

From 2014 - 2017 I headed up design and development of the Goshen College website, a large WordPress multisite, doing templating in [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) and logic in PHP and JavaScript (mostly ES5). Much of my work revolved around user experience design, web performance, SEO, improving data quality in our web form → Marketo → Salesforce funnel, and training web editors across campus.
