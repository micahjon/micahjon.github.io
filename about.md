Hi, I'm Micah! I'm a 25-year old web developer/designer who just moved to Portland, OR.

The past 3½ years I've headed up design and development of the [Goshen College](https://www.goshen.edu) website. This fall, I've decided to start doing web application development full-time to continue learning and growing, and am open to freelance and frontend job opportunities.

## Areas of Interest

- Designing in the browser
- Web performance (frontend & backend)
- Progressive web apps (PWAs)
- JavaScript frameworks (Preact, Ember)
- Maintainable content strategies

At Goshen College, I worked on a large WordPress multisite, doing templating in [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) and logic in PHP and JavaScript (mostly ES5). Much of my work revolved around user experience design, web performance, SEO, improving data quality in our web form → Marketo → Salesforce funnel, and training web editors across campus.

Lately, I've been working on several [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) web apps:

- An [event management tool](https://github.com/pranksinatra/homecoming-preact) built on Google Spreadsheets
- A [WordPress plugin](https://github.com/pranksinatra/network-database-search) for database searches

I'm well versed in ES5/6 fundamentals, but am actively exploring reactive data flows and test-driven development. If you have a product that uses Redux or TDD, I'd be more than interested in contributing.
