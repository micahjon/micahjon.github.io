Hi, I'm Micah! I'm a 24-year old web developer (and amateur UX designer) living in Goshen, Indiana.

Weekdays I work at <a href="https://www.goshen.edu">Goshen College</a> on the core Wordpress multisite, as well as a host of other PHP, Python, and Javascript based web-apps. I'm a little odd in that I enjoy both the design process (sketch on paper -> get feedback -> prototype in browser) and the challenge of development (building APIs, measuring performance, *and squinting at Chrome devtools*).

## Freelance

I'm currently not taking on paid Wordpress projects, but am open to freelance consulting. Mostly this takes the form of recommending a website platform that is easier to keep stable (e.g. Squarespace over Wordpress) and developing a strategy for initial content migration and upkeep down the road.

If you'd like to collaborate on an open source or Javascript-related project, I'd also be happy to sit down and talk. Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:micah.millereshleman@gmail.com">micah.millereshleman@gmail.com</a>.
