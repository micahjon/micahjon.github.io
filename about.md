# About Me

Hi, I'm Micah! I'm a full-stack engineer based in Portland, OR.

I'm currently heading up all things front-end at [Redwood Materials](https://redwoodmaterials.com/). I just started in November 2022 and am very excited to be working in green tech with a lot of talented people!

## Current Projects

When I'm not taking my cats for a walk, I'm often coding or thinking about one of these things:

- Experimenting with all sorts of solutions to identifying ads in podcasts<br>**Update:** check out [AdblockPodcast.com](https://www.adblockpodcast.com/)

- Learning how to be a dad.

- I spoke at the 2021 [PWA Summit](https://pwasummit.org/) and try and stay up-to-date on all things PWAs

Feel free to shoot me an email if you'd like to work on something together!<br>

## Past Projects

- Playing around with [object detection using Tensorflow](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-on-the-Raspberry-Pi) on a the Raspberry Pi B+.
- A Preact-based [WordPress plugin](https://github.com/micahjon/network-database-search) for cleaner database searches.
- A silly, social webapp called [Any Mammal's Milk](http://anymammalsmilk.com) first written in Svelte then migrated to React + Firebase.

## BeFunky

Before Redwood, I worked at BeFunky for 5 years (2017 - 2022), a popular [Photo Editing](https://www.befunky.com/create/) and [Graphic Design](https://www.befunky.com/create/designer/) platform.

I was initially brought on to help the team finish migrating their flagship Flash product to web tech (WebGL canvas + web components). It took many months, but we did launch a desktop-oriented webapp, then did a complete overhaul to make it work well on mobile as well, and finally distributed the webapp across all platforms as an installable PWA. Along the way, I got to work on all sorts of fun stuff:

- Saving assets & user settings in IndexedDB
- Getting the app to work offline and with low-connectivity (using Workbox)
- Building web components using Haunted & Lit-HTML for templating
- Proxying all our backend services through Fastly so we could serve them from the same origin (avoiding DNS lookups)
- Trying my darnest to keep the site performant even as we were shipping more and more features!

## Goshen College

From 2014 - 2017 I headed up design and development of the Goshen College website, a large WordPress multisite, doing templating in [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) and logic in PHP and JavaScript (mostly ES5). Much of my work revolved around user experience design, web performance, SEO, improving data quality in our web form → Marketo → Salesforce funnel, and training web editors across campus.
