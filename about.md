Hi, I'm Micah! I'm a 26-year-old frontend engineer based in Portland.

I'm currently heading up frontend dev at BeFunky, a popular WebGL-based [Photo Editor](https://www.befunky.com/create/) and [Graphic Design tool](https://www.befunky.com/create/designer/) that runs in the browser.

In my free time, I'm working on a couple different things:

- <img src="/assets/images/object-recognition-92.jpg" alt="Trying out object recognition" class="object-detection-image">
    Playing around with [object detection using Tensorflow](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-on-the-Raspberry-Pi) on a the Raspberry Pi B+. 
- Bootstrapping [Decent Clothes](https://decentclothes.com/), a little Cambodian-based tailoring startup, with a friend. We're currently exploring [Reaction Commerce](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction) for our ecommerce stack.
- Converting a silly, Svelte webapp called [Any Mammal's Milk](http://anymammalsmilk.com) to React + Firebase.
- A Preact-based [WordPress plugin](https://github.com/pranksinatra/network-database-search) for cleaner database searches.

Just shoot me an email if you'd like to work on something together!

## Goshen College (2014-2017)

The previous 3½ years I headed up design and development of the [Goshen College](https://www.goshen.edu) website, a large WordPress multisite, doing templating in [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) and logic in PHP and JavaScript (mostly ES5). Much of my work revolved around user experience design, web performance, SEO, improving data quality in our web form → Marketo → Salesforce funnel, and training web editors across campus.
