Hi, I'm Micah! I'm a 25-year old web developer/designer who recently moved to Portland.

In October, I started at [BeFunky](https://www.befunky.com/) as a frontend engineer on their new WebGL-based photo editing webapp. It's been a good fit: I get to write tons of vanilla ES6 and focus on performance.

In my free time, I'm working on a couple different things:

- Reading up on machine learning and computer science in general
- A Preact-based [WordPress plugin](https://github.com/pranksinatra/network-database-search) for database searches
- A silly, Svelte-based webapp called [Any Mammal's Milk](http://anymammalsmilk.com)

Just shoot me an email if you'd like to work on something together!

## Goshen College (2014-2017)

The previous 3½ years I headed up design and development of the [Goshen College](https://www.goshen.edu) website, a large WordPress multisite, doing templating in [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) and logic in PHP and JavaScript (mostly ES5). Much of my work revolved around user experience design, web performance, SEO, improving data quality in our web form → Marketo → Salesforce funnel, and training web editors across campus.
