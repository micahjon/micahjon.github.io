# About Me

Hi, I'm Micah! I'm a full-stack engineer based in Portland, OR.

I'm currently leading the front-end team at BeFunky, a popular WebGL-based [Photo Editing](https://www.befunky.com/create/) and [Graphic Design](https://www.befunky.com/create/designer/) platform that runs in the browser. A lot of my work entails adding new features without sacrificing our core performance metrics.

## Current Projects

When I'm not taking my cats for a walk, I'm often coding or thinking about one of these things:

- Experimenting with various machine-learning solutions to identifying ads in podcasts
- Evaluating state machines (e.g. [Robot](https://github.com/matthewp/robot)) and minimalist UI frameworks (e.g. [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [Haunted](https://github.com/matthewp/haunted)) for use at work and various side projects
- Speaking at the [PWA Summit](https://pwasummit.org/) on October 7th. It's all online and free to attend!

Feel free to shoot me an email if you'd like to work on something together!<br>

- Playing around with [object detection using Tensorflow](https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-on-the-Raspberry-Pi) on a the Raspberry Pi B+.
- A Preact-based [WordPress plugin](https://github.com/micahjon/network-database-search) for cleaner database searches.

## Goshen College

From 2014 - 2017 I headed up design and development of the Goshen College website, a large WordPress multisite, doing templating in [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) and logic in PHP and JavaScript (mostly ES5). Much of my work revolved around user experience design, web performance, SEO, improving data quality in our web form → Marketo → Salesforce funnel, and training web editors across campus.
