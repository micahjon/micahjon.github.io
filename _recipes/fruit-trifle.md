_A 4 layer dessert: cake, fruit, pudding, and whipped cream_

### Yellow cake

- Make half a yellow cake recipe. I used [this one](https://handletheheat.com/best-yellow-cake-recipe/#wprm-recipe-container-33109) and it turned out great.
- Cut cake into little cubes

### Fruit

- Fresh or frozen (thawed) berries
- Lemon juice
- Sugar

Add lemon juice and sugar to taste. I also add a hint of salt. If there is a lot of juice in the bowl that's a good thing.

### Pudding

1. 3.5 cups milk, heated until boiling (watch that it doesn't boil over!)

2. While milk is heating up, combine in small bowl:

- 1 cup sugar
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 4 tbsp cornstarch
- 6 tbsp flour

3. Add 1 cup cold milk to the dry ingredients to make a paste, then pour into boiling milk, stirring constantly until thickened.

4. Cover and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally

5. Crack 6 egg yolks into a small bowl. Stir a little bit of the milk mixture into the yolks, then add it to the hot milk, stirring constantly for 2 minutes.

6. Remove from heat.

7. Add 2 tbsp butter and 2 tsp vanilla

### Whipped Cream

Whip 2 cups of heavy whipping cream with a couple tbsp of sugar.

### Layer the trifle!

Put a layer of cake in the bottom of the glass container, and then add enough fruit & juice to soak the cake. Top with pudding and whipped cream, then repeat.

Trife is good fresh, but should get even better after a day or two, when the fruit has fully soaked into the cake.
