### Cream together:

- 1 cup butter (soft, not melted)
- 1.25 cup sugar (half white, half brown)
- 2 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla

### Mix dry ingredients:

- 1.5 cup quick oats
- 1 cup whole oats
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 cup flour

### Combine and add:

- 1 cup chocolate chips
- 1/3 cup chopped walnuts

Dont roll into neat balls. Irregularities are a good thing--this way you can have toasted peaks without crisping the whole outside of the cookie.

Bake at 375 °F (or 350 °F convection) and take out as soon a there are brown peaks. The cookie should be soft (barely baked through) on the inside.
