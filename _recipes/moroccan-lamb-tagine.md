_This is my favorite Moroccan dish--"tagine" being the name of the cone-shaped ceramic vessel that it's traditionally cooked in. It can be prepped quick in a dutch oven and then slow cooked._

#### Ingredients

- 2 cans of chickpeas
- 2 tsp grapeseed/olive oil
- 1 lb ground lamb (or chunks)
- Several carrots
- 1 tsp salt (divided)
- black pepper
- 1 small onion
- 3Â½ cup beef/chicken broth
- 3/4 cup chopped dried apricots
- 5 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 tsp minced ginger
- 1 tsp tumeric
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp sweet paprika (regular paprika works too)
- 1/2 tsp cinammon
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg
- 1/4 cup chopped parsely (optional)

Feel free to be a bit extra generous on the spices (heaping teaspoons) for more flavor.

We find it simplest to cook it all in a dutch oven, but you could also use a frying pan and slow cooker.

#### Instructions

1. Brown lamb and season with pepper and half of the salt. Set aside.
2. Saute onions until brown.
3. Add all the remaining ingredients except the salt & chopped parsely.
4. Cook for 4 hours (or less if you're in a hurry).
5. Add remaining salt & parsely before serving.

Serve over couscous or rice. We tried wild rice and it was a great combo.

Moroccans like to drink piping-hot green tea with mint or wormwood leaves and lots of sugar. It pairs very well with this dish.
