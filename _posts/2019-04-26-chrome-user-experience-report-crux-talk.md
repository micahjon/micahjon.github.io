description: Slides from lightning talk at JSAdmirers

At few days ago I gave a lightning talk on the Chrome User Experience Report (CrUX), based on a longer talk by [Rick Viscomi](https://gist.github.com/rviscomi) at the [#PerfMatters](https://perfmattersconf.com/) conference.

CrUX is a publicly queryable dataset of real world performance data about your domain. I came back from the conference and was able to build a few charts for BeFunky that help us track FID and FCP and compare against our competitors over time.

For instance, here's a [chart of the befunky.com domain's fast FCP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZOuKdzBT5FUNmr2M0HyOacacqN_2NXH_4wt6oo0rLiY/edit#gid=1955664146) (percent of users experiencing first-contentful-paint under 1 second) compared against our competitors.

Check out [Rick's Gist](https://gist.github.com/rviscomi/250bee3c02d1bf9e6e1f528c8813c535) for a bunch of great links on CrUX and building charts like the one above.

And, [here's my slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1anw_0hnYHSglyt1lIEmyUAAJmZpP2BZCjfx0vvihF8Y/edit?usp=sharing) from the lightning talk.
